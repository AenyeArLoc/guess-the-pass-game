# guess-the-pass-game

<p>I was inspired to create this game by a mini-game from the <em>Fallout</em> game series. 

In <a href="https://aenyearloc.github.io/guess-the-pass-game">the game</a> you have to guess the hidden word, which you are given 4 attempts. If you are wrong, the wonderful host of 
the game(It's me) will tell you how many matches of letters in your chosen word and make come true</p>

<p><em>I used vanilla JS</em></p>
